## Country Redux

The main branch has the app build by using general state management principles.

The redux branch has the same app build using Redux Old.

## Redux

Redux has three main components

1. Store : which has all the data
2. Reducer : which will mutate the data - tell how to do
3. Actions : which will tell what to do.

Genreal design thinking:

1. Identify what state exists in the app.
2. Identify how state changes over time.
3. Group together common piece of state.
4. Create a slice for each group.
